                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a college student here at Ozarks Technical Community
                    College. I started in the fall of 2022. I am working towards getting
                    my associates in Computer Science, with plans on moving to a four year
                    college after achieving my degree to further my education. My end goal
                    is to become a video game developer. I grew up playing video games, from
                    sandbox games like Minecraft to classics like Pac-Man. During my senior year
                    of highschool I took a video game development class as my "fun" class that
                    year. It mainly dealt with teaching us how to use unity. It was some of the
                    most fun I have ever had and is what led me to deciding to take video game
                    development as my career path.

                <p>
                    I mostly spend my time either reading or gaming. I enjoy reading books
                    like Tolkeins Lord of the Rings, the Iliad and the Odyssey. I have played
                    a variety of video games, from Lego games, to Minecraft, To Pac-Man and so
                    much more!

                <h1>Work Experience</h1>
                    <p>
                        At the moment, I work as a pet-sitter in my local area. I have pet-sat
                        for a variety of animals, from indoor animals like dogs, cats to barnyard
                        animals like horses and pigs. I have been pet=sitting since I began college
                        as a way to help pay expenses. I've gotten experience with feeding, walking,
                        cleaning and so much more. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also have help out at my local animal shelter from time to time,
                        for several years now. I have helped with transporting animals, to walking
                        them, to feeding them, to cleaning up the area. I have worked with other
                        volunteers as well as the board members of the shelter.
